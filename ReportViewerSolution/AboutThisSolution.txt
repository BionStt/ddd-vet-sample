The PatientHistoryTabletApp is a CRUD solution. It isn't complex and therefore doesn't require DDD.

Most of the apps functionality will be to retrieve data.
Users can search for pateitns and retrieve info and visit history records for a selected patient.
Users can create a new Visit record for a selected, existing patient.
The only data the user will add is a note, which is a text field.
The app will already know the date and time, the user (based on a login) and the patient (based on selection).

The solution was developed using BDD. We defined the features, then created
tests from those features and then created the domain types, repository and data access based on the needs defined in the tests.

Because of its simplicity, many of the tests are integration tests, that leverage Entity Fraemwork and interact with an database.
The database is created (and recreated) on the fly for each given test run.
